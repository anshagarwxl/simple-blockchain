About This Project

This is a very simple and basic blockchain project created by me to understand the fundamentals of blockchain technology. The goal of this project is to implement a basic blockchain structure using C++ and SHA-256 hashing.

Code Contribution

main.cpp: Most of this code was written by me, except for a few tweaks and improvements suggested by ChatGPT.

sha256.cpp: The majority of this code was generated with the help of ChatGPT. Since SHA-256 is a well-known cryptographic hashing algorithm, implementing it from scratch is unnecessary and would be highly complex. Instead, the implementation relies on OpenSSL, which is an industry-standard library for cryptographic operations.

Features

Implements a simple blockchain structure with blocks containing:

Transaction data

Previous hash reference

SHA-256 hash

Nonce value

Uses SHA-256 for hashing transactions.

Demonstrates how blocks are linked together using cryptographic hashes.
